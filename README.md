### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this lesson, I learned all about JavaScript. For starters, I learned some of the basic syntax rules for Java Script. They are as followed: JavaScript is case-sensitive. It ignores extra whitespace within statements. In order for the code to work, the statement must end in a semi-colon. 
2. Like HTML, JavaScript allows the user to write a comment in the code; however, the way the comments are coded differ. With HTML, the code for a comment is // (single lines) or <!-- (multiple lines), and for Javascript, the code is // (single lines) or /** (multiple lines).
3. In JavaScript, variables are used to store memory. Like the basic rules for JavaScript, variables are case sensitive. Also, they have to begin with the letter or the underscore character. The reserved keyword for variable is var.
